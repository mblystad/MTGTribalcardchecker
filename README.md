# MTGTribalcardchecker
A simple app that checks for new tribal creature cards and writes these to a txt file. Based on the mtgsdk library. Written with a great deal of help from copilot/chatgtp. 



# Freesh Tribal Card Checker

## Overview

The **Freesh Tribal Card Checker** is a simple Python GUI application designed for Magic: The Gathering (MTG) enthusiasts. It allows users to check for new creature cards of specific tribes (e.g., Elf, Vampire, Dragon) released within a selected date range. The results include detailed card information and a list formatted for easy import into tools like Moxfield.

## Features

- **Date Range Selection**: Choose start and end dates using an intuitive calendar widget.
- **Tribe Filtering**: Select from a dropdown list of popular MTG tribes (e.g., Angel, Goblin, Zombie).
- **Set Filtering**: Automatically filters MTG sets released within the chosen date range.
- **Card Details Export**: Outputs card details to a text file, including:
  - Card names
  - Types
  - Subtypes
  - Sets they belong to
- **Unique Card List**: Generates a list of unique cards formatted for Moxfield imports.
- **Dark-Themed GUI**: A clean and modern user interface built with [CustomTkinter](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter).

## Installation
